We should declare environment variables for GitHub repo owner and repo name if none of them are null then by default owner-apache and repo-airflow will be considered and file paths need to be declared for CSV files.

export owner="apache";

export repo="airflow";

export Last_Year_Commit_Activity_Filename="/Users/oyo/NetBeansProjects/javacourse/src/CIQTask/last_year_commit_activity.csv";

export Addition_Deletion_Activity_Filename="/Users/oyo/NetBeansProjects/javacourse/src/CIQTask/additions_deletions.csv";

//Compile the java file as well before below command using java -o or something similar

java -jar RestClientAPI.java

//Run the r program command

r graphs.r
